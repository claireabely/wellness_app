I created my wellness App Store by using react and mongo db. I created my backend database  by creating an array of objects within the Menuitems, orders and stores js files. I created two separate repositories on GitHub one for my react front end and one for my api backend. I then deployed my finished backend api to heroku and used this link to fetch data to my front end with react. My store has several different pages which can be navigated through the NavBar links. The homepage features the different categories of stores within the wellness app market and the menu items page features the items with images and prices that are within the different store categories. When add to cart is clicked on the item, the cart is added to the Your Orders component and the prices of the selected items are added together so that the customer can see the total price of their order. When the customer enters their email, name and address below the your orders total, and then presses place order, the order is placed and then rendered on the “cart” page which can be reached by clicking the link in the nav bar.  The orders in the cart are each given an individual order id #, just as they would on any online store. The order then has delete and edit functionality where the customer can cancel their most recently placed order or click edit to add or delete items from this order. Also in the nabber is the “Health Education” page where customers can read articles on the latest supplements and herbs recommended by the wellness app staff. Lastly, the “Log” link in the nav bar is a comment form where the customer can add, edit and delete notes on their wellness journey or create a shopping list to remember items that they plan to buy in the future. 

After completing this, I deployed my react frontend to heroic. 

In the future I plan to make the website more user friendly, I plan to connect the stores and menu items pages so that when you click on one category it will take you to the items for that store only. I also want to create an add edit and delete feature on the Health Education page where customers can share their favorite natural supplements.

For this project, I used the following resources-
